Introduction

IMtaTCR: to identify tumor-associated TCRs by comparing the TCR clusters in tumor tissues to in adjacent normal tissues

######################
System Requirement

It runs on Linux systems.
Perl, R, and python3 need to be installed for your system

######################
Installation

   1. Before use it, R package "DEGseq" is required to install
   2. Download the IMtaTCR.tar.gz to your directory, uncompress it.
        tar -zxvf IMtaTCR.tar.gz

Version: V1.0.0

1. Usage:
[parameters]
            IMtaTCR: to identify tumor-associated TCRs (taTCRs) by comparing the TCR repertoire in tumors with that in normal tissue

            -i      <S> input file
            -o      <S> out directory
            -R      <S> directory of Rscript [usr/bin/Rscript]

            -n     <I>  total read number for individual's normalization [100000]
            -f1     <Fl> select cluster with the frequency TCRs in tumor for GLIPH2 and iSMART [0.001]
            -f2     <Fl> select cluster with the frequency TCRs in tumor for ALICE [0.0001]
            -l1     <I> select cluster with foldchange from DEGseq for GLIPH2 and iSMART [2]
            -l2     <I> select cluster with ratio(tumor/normal) for ALICE [2]
            -p1     <Fl> select cluster with p-value from DEGseq for GLIPH2 and iSMART [1e-10]

Note
            1. If the sequence including C region, the compulsory parameters: -i -o R


######################
The format of -i: four columns: <individual><sample><flag><data>
	<individual>: the name of patient
	<sample>: sample name
	<flag>: "Tumor" or "Normal"
	<data>: the path of sequencing data
	see the example in "IMtaTCR/Test/input.txt"

2. After running the IMtaTCR.pl program, *.sh would be generated, then running the *.sh as follows:
	1)sh step1.sh
	2)sh step2_gliph2.sh, step2_ismart.sh, and step2_alice.sh
	3)sh step3.sh
